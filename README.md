# Project Title

Working title: Doguments

## Overview

Doguments is a CRUD application designed to hold of all your furry friends' crucial information. From keeping veterinary records in one secure spot to tracking changes in your pet's weight, exercise, or consumption trends, Doguments is there to be your animal companion's companion.

### Problem Space

It can be difficult to keep track of all your pets' veterinary records, especially when you have a pet with a chronic condition that requires frequent veterinary visits. While veterinary services maintain their clients' records, it is beneficial for the client to have easy access to their pets' veterinary history. When emergencies arise and a pet must attend a different veterinary hospital, having the animal's medical history with the client saves valuable time spent having those records transferred over. Furthermore, during off-hour emergency services, it may not be possible to have those records transferred at all.
Additionally, in the veterinary industry record-keeping and tracking is a known paintpoint for veterinary professionals. Time that could be spnt attending to patients is spent transferring records to other offices. By providing users access to their own pet's veterinary records in one secure spot, the demand on veterinary professionals is lifted as the client takes on a greater responsibility in their pets' healthcare.

In short, Doguments aims to:

-   Reduce the demand for veterinary professionals by decreasing need to transfer documents.
-   Allow the user easy access to their pets' documents in case of emergency.
-   Keep all a pet's crucial information in one spot (conditionas, medications, food etc.) to allow ease of access for both the user and veterinary professionals during intake, and keep track of any potentially concerning trends (change in food/water consumption, vomiting, changes in urination/defecation).
-   Simplify the user's scheduling and history by keeping a log of all veterinary visits and any upcoming scheduled visits.
